<h2>1. Why do I need a server for my PHP pages?</h2>

<p>PHP is a scripting language we use to write dynamically web pages, this means that we write a computer program using a high-level language which is understandable by us. So, to make computers understand it, we need to convert it to the machine language. A compiler or an interpreter is a program that coverts the high-level language into machine language. PHP language use an interpreter program, and you can imagine the web server is like visual studio program. So, for example, as Visual Basic language needs a visual studio(compiler), PHP language needs a web server(interpreter). Web server receives the source code from the client (browser) as an HTTP Request, then it converted to the machine language (data process), finally it sends it back to the browser as an HTTP Response (output).</p>


<h2>2. What is the difference between GET and POST?</h2>

<p>HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is deigned to transfer information between the client, browser and the server. The transferred information in an HTTP request-response is exposed to be hacked. The main difference between GET and POST methods is security level, POST is more secure way of transferring data. GET requests can be cashed, remain in the browser history, can be bookmarked, and have length restrictions, while POST requests are never cashed, do not remain in the browser history, cannot be bookmarked, and have no length restriction.</p>
